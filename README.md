# Amazoff

Using machine learning and deep learning techniques, we can accurately determine if user-submitted reviews are falsified. We can apply this determination to websites such as Amazon, TripAdvisor, Yelp, AirBnB, etc. and use it to create a more realistic, truthful measure of the quality of a product or service. 
This will be provided via an API service, LUCAS, usable by any project or product. Our flagship interface, Amazoff, will harness our API to fully demonstrate its power.
