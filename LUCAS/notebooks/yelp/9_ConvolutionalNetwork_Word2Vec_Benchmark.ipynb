    "# Convolutional Network Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a benchmark for a basic convolutional network, we will create a simple network that informs us what to expect when using these networks. This will not contain any novel specializations, it is done to find a baseline which we can improve upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture used here is inspired by the research in the form of the paper ['A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitionersâ€™ Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03820.pdf), and it not complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "While previous experiments have been done to find applicability of convolutional networks, this is the first to run it over a large set of data."
