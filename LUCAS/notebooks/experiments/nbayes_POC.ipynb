    "The accuracies produced in this notebook are not to be trusted as they are based on a very small dataset (1600 samples) with a TINY testing set (480 samples). However, it shows a proof of concept using simple Bag-Of-Words features such as count vectorization and Tf-idf to give a baseline model to improve on with larger datasets and more features.\n",
