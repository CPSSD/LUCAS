The SVC implementations in sklearn have an option to return probabilities which can be used to calculate the AUC, however Liblinear does not provide this. It is possible to use CalibratedClassifierCV to obtain probabilities, however this also tries to tune the hyperparameters and severely limits the amount of data we can ue. If we want to use LinearSVC we will have to leave this out for now. It is also possible to use SVC with a linear kernel, but the LinearSVM is known to perform better.~~\n",

    "## Metrics to evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy\n",
    "This is the percentage of correct classifications. The higher the better, however it is not appropriate in all cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric falls to the imbalanced classification problem. When there are many more of one class, the classifier can choose it much more, or all the time, to achieve a high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### False Positives, False Negatives\n",
    "False positives are samples that were classified as fake, but were in fact genuine. False negatives are samples that were classified as genuine, but were in fact fake. We want to reduce both of these values as much as possible. True positives and true negatives are the adverse values which we want to maximise, although they correlate to false positives and negatives so there's no need to include them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important question here is **False negatives vs False positives**? Is it worse to falsely suggest that something is fake, or is it worse to falsely suggest that something is genuine? Probably in this system a human might be paid to read those suspicious reviews. It would be good to catch all the fake reviews, plus some genuine ones, because this is just like filtering the huge number of reviews to make a human's job easier. In this case it is better to reduce false negatives. If humans are not reviewing the system, then this would be a different situation, it would probably be better to reduce false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall\n",
    "Of all the fake reviews, what percentage were identified as fake? This is not subject to the imbalanced\n",
    "classification problem. We aim to maximise it as an indication of how well we are really identifying our fake reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot focus solely on recall, because we could identify all reviews as fake and achieve 100% recall. Precision must be included in the consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision\n",
    "Of all the reviews identified as fake, what percentage are actually fake? If we classify all reviews as fake, then our precision will be low. If we classify all reviews as genuine, then we wont have any precision either.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case it might be more important to have a high recall, if we don't want to miss any fake reviews. Otherwise if we want to be as accurate as possible we can balance recall and precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### F1 Score\n",
    "This is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. Because of this it punishes extreme values such as a recall of or a precision of 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This also acts as a single number metric representing precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Area Under Curve (AUC) \n",
    "This gives us a measure of discrimination, how well we correctly classify both classes. This does not use a 'Yes' or 'No' which can make it more interesting than accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "At different classification thresholds, how well do we predict fake reviews as 'more fake' than genuine reviews. We plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate to get a graph. Changing the threshold allows us to create a graph because at low thresholds we will have more fake reviews, increasing the true positives rate. Decreasing the treshold means we will have less genuine reviews, decreasing the true negative rate, which therefore increases the false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "An AUC of 0.8 means the chance of the model distinguishing positive and negative classes is 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Squared Error\n",
    "The average of the square difference between the original values and the predicted values. Adds focus to large errors, and is easier to compute than mean absolute error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The closer the mean squared error is to zero the better. It incorporates the variance and the bias of the estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logarithmic loss\n",
    "This takes into account the uncertainty of a prediction, taking into account how far away from the actual label the prediction is. As the probability approaches correct the log loss reduces only very little. As the probability approaches incorrect the log loss increases rapidly. This means that confident incorrect values are highly penalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to minimize log loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cohen's Kappa\n",
    "A reliability metric used when there is more than one classifier. Computes an agreement percentage of the used classifiers. It is out of scope at this stage."
