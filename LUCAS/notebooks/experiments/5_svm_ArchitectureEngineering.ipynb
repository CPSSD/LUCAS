    "Since LinearSVC uses LibLinear it is not possible to retrieve the probabilities to calculate the AUROC or F1 score. The SVC implementations in sklearn have an option to return probabilities which can be used to calculate the AUC, however Liblinear does not provide this. It is possible to use CalibratedClassifierCV to obtain probabilities, however this also tries to tune the hyperparameters and severely limits the amount of data we can ue. If we want to use LinearSVC we will have to leave this out for now. It is also possible to use SVC with a linear kernel, but the LinearSVM is known to perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of this, I will use Logistic Regression which is very similar to LinearSVC, and performs similarly. Logistic regression will allow me to view these metrics and once I have explored how to improve this I can switch back to LinearSVC. Both classifiers attempt to divide the samples, and logistic regression is known to do a good job at producing a wide margin in it's division, which is what SVMs try to do."
